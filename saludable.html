    <div class="p1color"> <p><b>Hi there,<b/> I am glad you found your way to my first post. Let me introduce myself as the regular girl that would seat next to you on the train, or most realistically, the one standing next to you.  I am not a fitness guru or plan to be, and I certainly have no culinary skills or two-digit number hours of YouTube cooking. So we have something in common. I am an everyday person. Before you think that improving your lifestyle is too hard, let me just say that it is possible. I work around 35-40 hours a week while studyinf full-time and still squish some time to have a Health-ish lifestyle. Even if that means refusing a free donut and getting a banana. In this blog you will learn how finding better alternatives became part of who I am and why I approached a health-ish lyfestyle. Next time, I will go deeper on how I went from living with my parents in a small Venezuelan town to leaving everything behind and moving to New York City. </p>

    <p>I am glad you are still here. Getting to this point of my life wasn’t a smooth path. Even enjoying the process of learning about healthier food choices or how to cook wasn’t always on my “to do list”. And if you are here, I hope we can discover together what health-ish! really means. In this precise moment of my life, I would define it as whatever you are content with providing your body as a better alternative of what the market offers you. I hope you aren’t here just because you are my professor grading my site or my aunt trying to get any clue about  my romantic life, but you are here to learn how to make some "hella good" pancakes. </p>

    <p>Now that we all know what health-ish means, let me also say that this is my safe virtual space where I can be open and brutally honest. It is easy to look at others and compare the way they eat, look, and even live their lives. I wish someone had told me this when I first moved to New York City and was only 19 years old. In the last years - even couple of months- I experienced multiple body changes. I discovered the importance of taking care of myself from within first. In the beginning, it was a challenge for me to stay away from sweets and candies, as I came from a country with extreme food scarcity. I just couldn’t help myself! It took me some time to enjoy preparing my own meals and creating a delicious version of what I could eat for triple the amount of saturated fats and unnecessary calories. Any habit takes time. I just recently started eating Greek yogurt again because I was somehow reluctant to eat it as my very first in America was at a frozen yogurt store. I was making pennies and to save up some money I would sample the froyo (frozen yogurt as some hipsters may call say) to the point that samples would become my meal. If I had to go to school, I would buy a coffee and a bagel or some pastry for $2. However, this eating pattern was paid with my health, stamina, and self-esteem. I gained weight and no longer fitted on my clothes. I didn’t have enough energy to walk up the stairs on the train station, and most important: I was not content.</p>

    <p>You should feel content, nourished, and grateful you have so many food choices and a creative mind -or internet- to create delicious meals. I hope we can create a community where being ourselves is the only way to be.</p>
    <p> Insert cliché phrase: Let's be health-ish together!
